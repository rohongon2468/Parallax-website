                NAP has been the flagship afforestation scheme of the Ministry, implemented since year 2000 on pan India
                basis, for afforestation in identified degraded forest areas with people’s participation and
                decentralised forest governance. GIM activities were started in 2015-16. NAP and GIM, along with other
                afforestation schemes, have been contributing in restoration of degraded forest areas in the country.
                <br><br>
                In order to achieve the targeted objectives of national afforestation programmes, the Ministry has
                approved merger of NAP into Green India Mission (GIM) and accordingly financial allocation for both the
                schemes is provided under one budgetary head so that the overall greening efforts are augmented.

                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight,
                free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
                harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the
                suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
                forces of the air flowing over the outside.

            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a
                board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the
                surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also
                be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in
                wave pools.
